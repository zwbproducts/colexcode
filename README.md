# colexcode

This is an old legendary game taken from c++ from scratch by jesse liberty the same author of teach yourself c++ in 21 days and others. I am modernizing the code as its all c++98 which is ancient, right now this project 
is still in the very early stages, but here is the code updated with std::vector instead of arrays and other STL goodies added.
I am trying to get opengl in so it has a better gui than just text

# New update - 18 January 2026 -

I am finally contributing the full updates! Now I took the original code it's purest form and now re-engineering entirely up until c++17 and adding some other new goodies of the modern standards eventually.

Thanks
