# colexcode

This is an old legendary game taken from c++ from scratch. I am modernizing the code as its all c++98 which is ancient, right now this project 
is still in the very early stages, but here is the code updated with std::vector instead of arrays and other STL goodies added.
I am trying to get opengl in so it has a better gui than just text.

Thanks
